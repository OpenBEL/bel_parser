SUPPORTED ON
============

Colm is supported on Unix-like systems. It depends on GCC at runtime.

BUILDING
========

Colm is built in the usual autotool way:

$ ./autogen
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Notes on RUNNING
================

Colm produces a C program as output, then compiles and links it with a runtime
library. It will leave the C program behind as an artefact.

To find the includes and the runtime library, colm looks at argv[0] to decide
if it is running out of the source tree. If it is, then compile and link flags
are derived from argv[0]. Otherwise, it uses the install location (prefix) to
construct the flags.

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING
===================

There is a vim syntax definition file colm.vim
