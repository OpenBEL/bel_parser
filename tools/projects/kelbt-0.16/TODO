Should be possible to define a nonterminal type as some kind of simple type, As
it is, the user is forced to make it into a structure which is referenced by a
pointer.

Should also be possible to set the default type for all nonterminals.

The parse tables use up a lot of static memory. Need a compressed table
representation.
