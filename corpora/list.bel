"OMIM summary: Human: The extrinsic pathway of blood coagulation is initiated by contact of plasma factor VII (F7; {227500}) with tissue factor (F3), a cellular membrane glycoprotein that normally is segregated from the bloodstream but can be exposed after tissue injury or newly synthesized in endothelial cells or leukocytes after stimulation by endotoxin and cytokines. Once formed, the tissue factor/factor VII complex converts to a complex of tissue factor and enzymatically active factor VII (F7a); this conversion leads to activation of factors X and IX and prothrombin, and ultimately to formation of fibrin. These processes are regulated by plasma protease inhibitors and by the thrombomodulin ({188040})-protein C ({176860}) pathway. A further regulatory mechanism in the extrinsic pathway is called tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI; {152310}). For a review, see {3:Davie et al. (1991)}. Pubmed titles from omim summary: (no summary available from this source): Entrez Gene GeneRifs summary: Human: This gene encodes coagulation factor III which is a cell surface glycoprotein. This factor enables cells to initiate the blood coagulation cascades, and it functions as the high-affinity receptor for the coagulation factor VII. The resulting complex provides a catalytic event that is responsible for initiation of the coagulation protease cascades by specific limited proteolysis. Unlike the other cofactors of these protease cascades, which circulate as nonfunctional precursors, this factor is a potent initiator that is fully functional when expressed on cell surfaces. There are 3 distinct domains of this factor: extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic. This protein is the only one in the coagulation pathway for which a congenital deficiency has not been described.

Both molecules are critical for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent signal transduction, and sCD14 confers LPS sensitivity to cells lacking mCD14.

"Entrez Gene summary: Rat: SUMMARY: interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR alpha); can form a dimer with other nuclear hormone receptors [RGD] ... Human: The protein encoded by this gene is an unusual orphan receptor that contains a putative ligand-binding domain but lacks a conventional DNA-binding domain. The gene product is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor family, a group of transcription factors regulated by small hydrophobic hormones, a subset of which do not have known ligands and are referred to as orphan nuclear receptors. The protein has been shown to interact with retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors, inhibiting their ligand-dependent transcriptional activation. In addition, interaction with estrogen receptors has been demonstrated, leading to inhibition of function. Studies suggest that the protein represses nuclear hormone receptor-mediated transactivation via two separate steps: competition with coactivators and the direct effects of its transcriptional repressor function. OMIM summary: Human: The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of transcription factors regulated by small hydrophobic hormones such as retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and steroids. This superfamily also includes orphan nuclear receptors, such as NR0B2, which are related proteins that do not have known ligands ({7:Seol et al., 1996})."

"% OMIM summary: Human: The process of differentiation from mesodermal precursor cells to myoblasts has led to the discovery of a variety of tissue-specific factors that regulate muscle gene expression. The myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins, including myoD ({159970}), myogenin ({159980}), MYF5 ({159990}), and MRF4 ({159991}) are 1 class of identified factors. A second family of DNA binding regulatory proteins is the myocyte-specific enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family. Each of these proteins binds to the MEF2 target DNA sequence present in the regulatory regions of many, if not all, muscle-specific genes. The MEF2 genes are members of the MADS gene family (named for the yeast mating type-specific transcription factor MCM1, the plant homeotic genes 'agamous ' and  'deficiens ' and the human serum response factor SRF ({600589})), a family that also includes several homeotic genes and other transcription factors, all of which share a conserved DNA-binding domain."

"Transfection of K562 cells with FKLF cDNA enhanced the expression of the endogenous epsilon- and gamma-globin genes, suggesting an in vivo role of FKLF in fetal and embryonic globin gene expression. Our results indicate that the protein potentially encoded by the FKLF cDNA acts as a transcriptional activator of embryonic and fetal beta-like globin genes {investigation of promoter bindining sequences was performed}"

"IKK-i is expressed mainly in immune cells, and is induced in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6, in addition to LPS. We examined whether other stimuli induce IKK-i expression. Stimulation of RAW264.7 cells with IL-6 and IFN-{gamma} induced IKK-i mRNA expression. IKK-i mRNA expression was up-regulated upon stimulation of thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with TNF-{alpha}, IL-1ß, IFN-{gamma} and IL-6 in addition to LPS. In contrast, mRNA expression levels of IKK-{alpha} or IKK-ß were not augmented in response to these stimuli."

"xamination of the TGF{alpha} promoter sequence (Fig. 10Go) revealed the presence of both an octamer-like sequence between nt -610 and -603, and a downstream sequence between nt -596 and -587 similar to the TAATGARAT element in the HSV promoter, which has been shown to mediate inhibitory transcriptional effects of Oct-2 proteins (52, 63). Cotransfection of C6 cells with a reporter plasmid carrying a fragment of the TGF{alpha} promoter (-637 to +67) that contains both the octamer and the HSV-like motifs, and expression vectors containing either the Oct-2a or Oct-2c coding regions resulted in stimulation of the promoter’s activity (Fig. 10AGo).

"Enforced expression of Par-4 induces apoptosis, which is abrogated by cotransfection of PKC{zeta} but not its kinase-inactive mutant (39)"
"In addition, the cytoplasmic and membrane-associated protein p62 ZIP targets the activity of PKC{zeta} to the KvB2 subunits of potassium channels (42) . Given the importance of these channels for the regulation of some apoptotic pathways (43) , alterations of PKC{zeta} interaction with the protein ZIP could also account for the proapoptotic activity of the PKC{zeta} dominant-negative mutant"

"T cell–enriched LPMCs from T-bet knockout mice secreted lower levels of IFN-{gamma} than cells from wild-type littermates in the absence of colitogenic stimuli. In contrast, production of the Th2 type cytokines IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 by T cell–enriched LPMCs was augmented in T-bet–deficient animals compared with wild-type mice."

"Transcriptional regulation of AE2 {SLC4A2} was also evaluated in differentiated HBE cells stimulated with H2O2. AE2 mRNA expression was analyzed by RT-PCR. A single band corresponding to the 411-base pair product of the AE2 primers was obtained. The relative quantity of the AE2 mRNA was normalized against that of GAPDH (Fig. 5). Minimal AE2 mRNA expression was seen at baseline in the unstimulated cells, despite amplification to 36 cycles. This expression significantly increased within 4 h of exposure to H2O2. This increase persisted 12 h after exposure with return to near baseline by 24 h. "

"The ability of Tpl2 to regulate COX-2 expression depends on ERK signals that activate p90Rsk and Msk1, which in turn phosphorylate CREB, a key regulator of COX-2 transcription. The ERK phosphorylates p90Rsk at serine-364, 381 and threonine-360, which in turn phosphorylates Creb1 at serine-133 in cells treated by the LPS. The ERK mediated phosphorylation of p90Rsk was abrogated in Tpl2-/- cells. {Tpl2 Official Gene Symbol: MAP3K8, p90Rsk Official Gene Symbol: Rps6ka1, Msk1 Official Gene Symbol: Rps6ka5}"

"***This is a review paper.  The paper is not being curated completely.  I am only curating selectively the contents of the body that pertains to FANCA expression controllers.****   Treatment of normal HeLa fibroblasts with TNF-{alpha} induces FANCG protein expression and phosphorylation. FANCA is induced concurrently with FANCG and the FANCA/FANCG complex is increased in the nucleus following TNF-{alpha} treatment (Futaki et al., 2001Go)"

"however, after stimulation with interleukin-1beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, levels of ESE-3 mRNA and protein increase dramatically by 24 h. ESE-3 mRNA and Protein Are Inducibly Expressed in Human Bronchial Smooth Muscle Cells after Treatment with TNF-{alpha} or IL-1beta To test the hypothesis that ESE-3 may be induced in other cells of the airways in response to inflammatory cytokines of relevance to asthma, we exposed HBSMC to TNF-{alpha} and IL-1beta. ESE-3 mRNA was induced 6 to 24 h after treatment with both cytokines, each at a concentration of 5 ng/ml, and detected by RT-PCR"

"AKT promoted YAP localization to the cytoplasm, resulting in loss from the nucleus, where it functions as a coactivator of transcription factors, including p73 ({601990}). p73-mediated induction of BAX ({600040}) expression following DNA damage required YAP function and was attenuated by AKT phosphorylation of YAP."

"Interestingly, expression of a constitutively active form of Akt causes spontaneous differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells.37 The experimental manipulation of cAMP, various G proteins, and protein kinase C isoforms have also been shown to affect adipogenesis in vitro.38 A more thorough knowledge of the critical extracellular signals involved in fat cell development would better enable us to place these findings in their appropriate context.  Another environmental condition that affects adipogenesis is hypoxia, which inhibits the process. This effect seems to be mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor 1{alpha} (HIF-1 {alpha}), which represses transcriptional induction of PPAR{gamma} via an intermediate factor, called DEC1/Stra13.39"
"The JNK MAP kinase can also phosphorylate PPAR{gamma} at this inhibitory site.34"

"All four resistant lines contained a monoallelic point mutation in the PPAR{gamma} gene at codon 422 resulting in a  change from lysine (Lys) to glutamine (Gln) (K422Q); this mutation was not found in the four sensitive cell lines (Table I). The correlation between the K422Q allele and lack of sensitivity to PPAR{gamma} ligands provided suggestive, but not definitive, evidence that this mutation caused the HCT 15, MIP 101, Clone A, and COLO 205 cell lines to be resistant to the growth inhibitory effects of PPAR{gamma} ligands."

"Although IL-4 mRNA was detected in wild-type splenocytes, no expression was detected in splenocytes from BATF transgenic mice (Fig. 5B). The same result was obtained for IL-13 mRNA (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the induction of IFN-{gamma} mRNA, which is not an exclusive property of NKT cells within this time-frame (24, 27), was similar in wild-type and transgenic mice (Fig. 5B). These results are consistent with the data in Fig. 5A and suggest that the overexpression of BATF negatively impacts the NKT cell compartment in these animals."

"To examine how BATF-mediated negative control of AP-1 activity influences specific transitions in thymic T cell development, the p56lck proximal promoter was used to drive expression of an HA Ag-tagged BATF protein in mice. Two founder animals positive for the transgene were bred to generate the FVB-lck line 2 and FVB-lck line 4 mice used in these studies (Fig. 1A).  To determine whether the overexpression of BATF influences cytokine gene expression, thymocytes and splenocytes from wild-type and transgenic FVB-lck line 2 littermates were stimulated in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3{epsilon} mAb. Total RNA was isolated after 24 h, and RPA was performed. The induction of IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 mRNA by transgenic thymocytes is impaired relative to that in wild-type controls, while the expression of IL-6 and IFN-{gamma} mRNA is comparable (Fig. 2A). Transgenic splenocytes showed reduced expression of IL-4 and IL-5 and enhanced expression of IL-2 (Fig. 2A). The RPA was repeated with RNA prepared from FVB-lck line 4 animals, and similar results were obtained (data not shown)."

"The presence of anti–TNF-{alpha} abs in the growth medium decreased cell adhesion by 67% in CSE- or C5a-stimulated BEAS-2Bcells (P < 0.001 for each comparison). Likewise, when BEAS-2B were exposed to both CSE and C5a in the presence of anti–TNF-{alpha} abs, over 68% of THP-1 adhesion events were inhibited (Figure 3) (P < 0.001)."
"These results suggest that smoke invokes the activation of PKC in BEAS-2B to increase the ability of these epithelial cells to adhere THP-1 cells. In addition, airway epithelial/THP-1 binding induced by smoke or C5a appear to operate through the local, cellular effects of TNF-{alpha}."

"BTC rapidly induced the phosphorylation of Akt, GSK3alpha/beta, and two FoxO factors, FKHR and AFX, in a dose- and time-dependent manner.  we first examined the effect of BTC on phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) and ERK1/2 in primary cultured HTASMCs. BTC (10 ng/mL) increased the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream kinase, GSK3{alpha}/ß (Ser21/Ser9), as early as 1 minute and produced a maximal effect at 1 minute (Figures 1A and 1B). "

", whereas no significant changes were observed in the total amount of this protein (Fig. 5, D and E). Therefore, the phosphorylation of p90rsk may be the link between ERK activation and GSK3{beta} phosphorylation. The stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin is triggered by the phosphorylation of GSK3{beta} at serine 9 and its concomitant inactivation."

"IL-1 was reported to be involved in the feeding suppression caused by leptin, which is released from adipocytes and suppresses food intake through actions in the hypothalamus. IL-1 promotes the release of corticotropin releasing factor (CRF; references 18, 19), melanocortins, and other neuropeptides (4). CRF suppresses feeding behavior when administered intracerebroventricularly. IL-1B selectively destroys the insulin-producing B cells, but not the {alpha} cells, in vitro. This cytotoxic effect of IL-1 is suggested to be mediated by the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase or prostaglandins On the other hand, it was reported that IL-1 acts as a hypoglycemic agent not only in normal animals but also in alloxan-induced diabetic and genetically diabetic mice (32) and increases insulin and glucagon levels, suggesting that IL-1 has antidiabetic effects (33)"

"From full text: we attempted to determine whether STAT1C-mediated apoptosis specifically involves the caspase pathway.. cleavage of caspase 7 was detected in transient transfection of WT. Apoptosis of 1CC cells by IFN-{gamma} (75%) was partially inhibited by coincubation with Z-VDVAD-FMK (49%). These results demonstrate that caspase 2 and, perhaps, caspase 3 and 7 are partially involved in STAT1C-mediated apoptosis."

"We further demonstrate that cav-1-stimulated Akt activities lead to increased phosphorylation of multiple Akt substrates, including GSK3, FKHR, and MDM2. The results in Fig. 9 demonstrated that the expression of cav1 significantly increased the phosphorylation of GSK3 (Ser9/21) (134%), FKHRL1 (Thr32) (47 to 80%), and MDM2 (Ser166) (78 to 81%) and marginally increased phosphorylation of BAD (Ser112) and IkappaB kinase alpha (IKK{alpha}) (Ser180)/IKKb (Ser181) but did not significantly alter phosphorylation of CREB (Ser133) and AFX (Ser193) under these conditions"

"While the activity of these enzymes in the newborn PEX2-/- mouse liver was normal, all enzyme activities were significantly elevated in the postnatal knockout mouse livers (Fig. 1A to D). The pattern observed in PEX2 knockout mice differed markedly, with enzyme activity continuing to increase in postnatal PEX2-/- mice. For example, HMG-CoA reductase {HMGCR} activity was increased 5-fold at P3-5 and 10-fold at P7-10 in knockout mice (Fig. 1A). Activities of IPP isomerase, {IDI1} FPP synthase {FDPS}, and squalene synthase {FDFT1} were increased twofold at P3-5 in PEX2-/- mice (Fig. 1B to D). At P7-10, the activities of FPP synthase and squalene synthase were increased 10-fold in mutant mice while IPP isomerase activity was increased 18-fold.  "

"Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of I{kappa}B phosphorylation, and NF-{kappa}B activation was used to determine whether chemokine induction by PGN is NF-{kappa}B dependent. Concentrations of Bay 11-7082 between 1.0 and 5 µM were used according to published studies. RA synovial fibroblasts were pretreated with Bay 11-7082 for 30 min, washed and subsequently stimulated with PGN for 4 h. Total RNA was then extracted and RANTES, GCP-2, and MCP-2 mRNA quantified by real-time PCR. There was a dose-dependent decrease of mRNA levels of the tested chemokines ranging from marked reduction upon treatment with 1 µM Bay 11-7082 to almost complete inhibition in the RA synovial fibroblasts pretreated with 5 µM Bay 11-7082.

"FIG. 7. The signaling arms of the mammalian UPR diverge to regulate some targets and converge to regulate others. The mammalian UPR activates three signal transducers, ATF6, Ire1, and PERK. 1) Activation of ATF6 leads to increased expression of genes regulated by ERSEs in their promoters including ER chaperones like BiP and GRP94, as well as the transcription factor XBP-1. Activation of Ire1 leads to alternative XBP-1 splicing, which in turn up-regulates XBP-1 specific targets like ERdj4, as well as targets with ERSEs in their promoter. A PERK-dependent target other than ATF4 can influence the activation of the ERSE site by an unknown mechanism, which is indicated by a question mark in the schematics. 2) PERK activation leads to eIF-2{alpha} phosphorylation, which allows the expression of the ATF4 transcription factor that in turn induces GADD34 transcription. There is no evidence at this time for members of the ATF6 and Ire1/XBP-1 pathways to impact on the PERK pathway. 3) Finally, the ATF6, Ire1/XBP-1 and PERK pathways converge to optimally induce targets that include CHOP and Herp. Those targets that are downstream of the PERK branch of the UPR are shared with various other cellular stress conditions like heme deficiency, amino acid deprivation, and dsRNA expression. These stresses all activate an eIF-2{alpha} kinase and as a result induce downstream targets like ATF4 and GADD34, as well as those that are dually regulated by both the shared and the ER stress-specific branches of the UPR, which are represented by CHOP and Herp.

"PGC-1{alpha} can also interact directly with and coactivate NRF-1 on the Tfam gene promoter. Third, studies in primary cardiac myocytes in culture and in the hearts of transgenic mice have demonstrated that overexpression of PGC-1{alpha} up-regulates the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, most of which are PPAR{alpha} targets, in addition to NRF-1 targets (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Cardiac-specific overexpression of PGC-1{alpha} in transgenic mice leads to massive mitochondrial proliferation, ultimately resulting in cardiomyopathy and death (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Interestingly, in neonatal cardiac myocytes in culture, PGC-1{alpha} induces mitochondria that support largely coupled respiration consistent with the known ATP-generating function of this organelle in heart (Lehman et al. 2000Go). Lastly, forced expression of PGC-1{alpha} in skeletal muscle of transgenic mice triggers mitochondrial proliferation and the formation of mitochondrial-rich type I, oxidative (\"slow-twitch\") muscle fibers (Lin et al. 2002bGo). Collectively, these results indicate that PGC-1{alpha} is capable of promoting mitochondrial biogenesis through its coactivating effects on key factors such as NRF-1."

"Figure 8. Endothelin induces {alpha}-SMA, paxillin, moesin, and ezrin expression; SSc fibroblasts overexpress {alpha}-SMA, paxillin, moesin, and ezrin in a manner that is dependent on endogenous ET-1 signaling. Normal and SSc fibroblasts were treated with and without 100 nM ET-1 (24 h) as indicated in the presence or absence of bosentan or wortmannin. Cell layers were harvested, and equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-{alpha}-SMA, anti-paxillin, anti-moesin, and anti-ezrin antibodies, as indicated. As a loading control, Western analysis with an anti-GAPDH antibody also was performed."

"The increased DGK{alpha} mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR analysis, showing {approx}5-fold to 8-fold increases in the mRNA levels after the treatment with PPAR{gamma} agonists (Figure 5B). .......To verify whether these PPAR{gamma} agonists effects are mediated by the receptors, we used a dominant-negative PPAR{gamma} mutant, PPAR{gamma}L468A/E471A, which has been shown to effectively silence the PPAR{gamma}-dependent gene transcriptions."

"The intensity of immunostaining for HuC/D {ELAVL3, ELAVL4}, which localizes predominantly to the cell body of immature and mature neurons (Sakakibara and Okano, 1997Go), was determined within the histone H2B-GFP+ area. Cells transfected with plasmids encoding S33Y ß-catenin (stabilized beta catenin) or Wnt7a and Fz5 exhibited higher levels of expression of HuC/D than did control cells transfected with the corresponding empty vectors, again suggesting that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway promotes neurogenesis in vivo."

"In contrast, anti-CD3 mAb stimulation without exogenous IL-12 induced a large amount of IFN-{gamma} (68.5 (5.0) ng/ml), as well as marked expression of T-bet (fig 3AGo–C). The level of T-bet induction by anti-CD3 mAb stimulation was not significantly different among CD4+ PBMCs from CD or UC patients, or NL (fig 3BGo). Consistent with mRNA expression, T-bet protein was augmented by anti-CD3 mAb stimulation in CD4+ PBMCs from patients with CD (fig 3CGo; similarly in UC and NL, but data not shown). Furthermore, in parallel with T-bet induction by anti-CD3 mAb stimulation, IL-12Rß2 was also induced in CD4+ PBMCs (fig 3DGo) and additional stimulation by IL-12 induced a fivefold greater amount of IFN-{gamma} (355.0 (62.2) ng/ml) than anti-CD3 mAb stimulation alone (fig 3AGo).

" T cells in peripheral airways of COPD patients show increased expression of CXCR3, a receptor activated by interferon-{gamma} inducible protein of 10 kDa (IP-10; CXCL10), monokine induced by interferon-{gamma} (Mig; CXCL9), and interferon-inducible T cell-{alpha} chemoattractant (I-TAC; CXCL11). All three cytokines activate CXCR3, although CXCL11 has the highest affinity."

"EGFR appear to play a key role in the regulation of mucus hypersecretion, with increased expression of mucin genes (MUC5AC, MUCB. EGFRs are activated by TGF-{alpha}, which is in turn activated by TACE activated via release of oxidants from cigarette smoke and neutrophils. TGF-{alpha} may also be activated by IL-13 and IL-9."
"Macrophages in COPD. Macrophages may play a pivotal role in COPD as they are activated by cigarette smoke extract and secrete many inflammatory proteins that may orchestrate the inflammatory process in COPD. Neutrophils may be attracted by IL-8, GRO-{alpha}, LTB4, MCP-1, and CD8+ lymphocytes by IP-10, Mig, and I-TAC. Release of elastolytic enzymes including MMPs and cathepsins causes elastolysis and release of TGF-{beta}1 and CTGF. Release of TGF-{alpha} activates EGFR, which stimulates mucus hypersecretion. Macrophages also generate ROS and NO, which together form peroxynitrite and may contribute to steroid resistance."
"Pro-TNF-{alpha} is finally converted to active TNF-{alpha} by a membrane-bound metalloproteinase called TNF-{alpha} converting enzyme (TACE), although other matrix metalloproteinases also have a greater or lesser degree of TNF-{alpha} converting potential (Gearing et al., 1994Go). In vitro MMP-12 also releases active TNF-{alpha} from a synthetic pro-form,"
"ROS activate NF-{kappa}B in an epithelial cell line (Adcock et al., 1994Go) and increase the release of proinflammatory cytokines from cultured human airway epithelial cells (Rusznak et al., 1996Go). Oxidative stress results in activation of histone acetyltransferase activity, which opens up the chromatin structure and is associated with increased transcription of multiple inflammatory genes (Rahman, 2003Go; Tomita et al., 2003Go)"
"TGF-{beta} is activated by MMP-9...TGF-{beta} causes small airway fibrosis and also activates MMP-9."
"There is increased COX-2 expression in alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD compared with normal control subjects (Taha et al., 2000Go). This is presumably a result of induction by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-{alpha} and IL-1{beta}, which activate NF-{kappa}B, the key regulator of COX-2 (Newton et al., 1997Go"

"In particular, we demonstrated that the addition of HA to CD44-containing SK-OV-3.ipl cells caused almost a 3-fold increase in the binding of [35S]GTP{gamma}S to Cdc42 compared with the amount of binding present in untreated SK-OV-3.ipl cells."
"In searching for a possible linkage between HA-CD44-mediated IQGAP1 signaling and ERK and ER{alpha} function, we demonstrated that IQGAP1-linked ERK2 isolated from SK-OV-3.ipl cells treated with HA was capable of phosphorylating ER{alpha} in vitro (Fig. 5A, bar b). EGF stimulation of MAPKs such as ERK1 and ERK2 has been shown to phosphorylate ER{alpha} at Ser118 in the N-terminal domain and to enhance transcriptional activity. ER{alpha} phosphorylation in vivo (as detected by anti-phospho-ER{alpha} antibody (Ser118)) was also greatly enhanced in SK-OV-3.ipl cells treated with HA.The level of ERE gene activity was low in untreated cells (bar a) or in cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody, followed by HA treatment (bar c). ERE gene activity was greatly enhanced in SK-OV-3.ipl cells treated with intact HA"

"Shn-2-deficient developing Th2 cells showed constitutive activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and enhanced GATA3 induction. . .  Increased amounts of p65 supershift band were detected after anti-TCR stimulation in Shn-2–/– T cells. Furthermore, an EMSA with anti-p50 antibody revealed that most of the NF-{kappa}B EMSA band detected in nonstimulated Shn-2–/– T cells contained the p50 subunit (Fig. 4 B, lane 11). There was a substantial increase in the level of the p50 band after anti-TCR stimulation (Fig. 4 B, lane 12). These results suggest that NF-{kappa}B is constitutively activated in Shn-2–/– CD4 T cells and it is hyperactivated after anti-TCR stimulation."

"From Fig. 4: Using the same time and dose strategies as before, a mean 6.2-fold induction of PLC{gamma} phosphorylation was observed following radiation treatment (Fig. 4). Increases in phosphorylation of Shc family members were observed following irradiation; the mean -fold changes (n = 3) were 2.3, 3.0, and 3.5 for the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa isoforms, respectively. For both PLC{gamma} and Shc, EGF at 10 ng/ml induced a significantly greater increase in phosphorylation than IR (p < 0.05). Pretreatment of cells with 500 nM AG1478, a specific inhibitor of EGFR Tyr phosphorylation (29), abolished the radiation- and EGF-induced activation of both PLC{gamma} and Shc in A431 cells."

"As previously reported, expression of Dok-R in EGF-stimulated cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in the induction of Erk-2 activation as well as a delay in the activation kinetics (Fig. 1), while Dok-R {Delta}PRR completely lost this Erk-2 attenuating capacity, which demonstrates that the key residues for mediating this attenuation are found within the PRR."

"MC were stimulated with IL-1{beta} (0.3 nM) and, to block endogenous NO formation, additionally with different concentrations of the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA for 24 h. In IL-1{beta}–treated MC, PDGFR{alpha} expression and NO formation (measured as nitrite, data not shown) was drastically increased (Figure 6). Co-administration of L-NMMA reduced IL-1{beta}–evoked PDGFR{alpha} expression in part (Figure 6) and blunted IL-1{beta}–induced NO formation (data not shown). We conclude from these data that endogenously produced NO at least partially triggers IL-1{beta}–driven PDGFR{alpha} expression."

In a rat model of inhaled heat-killed Moraxella catarrhalis,  the phenomenon seemed dependent on the expression of CCR1 and  CCR5, which are receptors for the chemokines CCL5 (regulated  on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted [RANTES])  and/or CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein [MIP]-1{alpha}) produced at the airway level "

"When M{phi} were pretreated with diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride (AEBSF), inhibitors that block ROS generation by NADPH oxidase, both superoxide production (Fig. 4A and data not shown) and cell death (Fig. 4B) were significantly attenuated after treatment with zVAD/LPS. We obtained similar results with rotenone, an inhibitor of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (Fig. 4B), suggesting that superoxide largely comes from both NADPH oxidase and mitochondria."

"A relatively small number of genes was up-regulated in E2f6-/- cells when compared with wild-type control cells (data not shown). Activation of genes in E2f6-/- cells is consistent with the proposed role for E2F6 in transcriptional repression. In this study we focused on two genes that were strongly up-regulated in E2F6-deficient cells and that encode for STAG3 and SMC1{beta}, meiotic specific subunits of the cohesin complex (19–21). Both proteins are required for proper segregation of chromosomes during meiotic division. Expression of a third gene, XM_196054, was also increased in E2f6-/- cells. This cDNA encodes for a novel protein with an unknown function. To validate the array data we analyzed the expression of these genes in different MEF preparations by RT-PCR. STAG3, SMC1{beta}, and XM_196054 were undetectable in wild-type fibroblasts and strongly elevated in E2f6-/- MEFs, confirming the microarray data (Fig. 1A)."

"Next, we wanted to test whether E2F6 binds directly to the predicted E2F-binding sites of the SMC1{beta} and STAG3 promoters. To address this question we performed gel retardation experiments with in vitro translated E2F6 and DP2 and radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the E2F sites of the SMC1{beta} and STAG3 promoters. Binding of E2F6 to these elements was compared with binding to the E2F-site of the DHFR promoter, a bona fide E2F-binding sequence (22). As shown in Fig. 3A, binding of E2F6 to the SMC1{beta} site was readily detected, whereas under the same conditions E2F6 did not significantly bind to the DHFR sequence (compare lane 1 and lane 7 in Fig. 3A). Preferential binding of E2F6 to the SMC1{beta} sites was confirmed by competition with unlabeled oligonucleotides. The SMC1{beta}, but not the DHFR oligonucleotide, efficiently competed for the binding of E2F6 to the E2F element (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–4). We concluded that E2F6 binds with higher affinity to the SMC1{beta} promoter than to the classical E2F binding site in the DHFR promoter. As described above, the STAG3 promoter contains an E2F site that is identical to the one in the SMC1{beta} promoter (Fig. 2D), and in vitro translated E2F6 readily bound to the STAG3 element (Fig. 3C).Endogenous E2F6 associated with the STAG3 promoter in wild-type MEFs (Fig. 4A, lane 3), although, as expected, its binding was weaker than the binding of the overexpressed protein."
"Repression of these SMC1{beta} promoter constructs by E2F6 was confirmed by inhibition of reporter gene expression by overexpressed E2F6 (Fig. 2C). A point mutant of E2F6 defective in DNA binding (E68) (6) had no effect on reporter gene expression, demonstrating that repression of SMC1{beta} by E2F6 depends on sequence-specific DNA-binding. The -26 promoter had equal activity in wild-type and E2f6-/- cells and was not repressed by the coexpression of E2F6. This finding suggests that an E2F6-responsive site is located between nucleotides -26 and -129 of the SMC1{beta} promoter. Examination of this part of the promoter sequence showed that it contains a potential E2F binding site (see Fig. 2D). To test whether this E2F site is required for repression of the SMC1{beta} promoter by E2F6, we mutated the E2F element and analyzed the activity of the mutated reporter construct in E2f6+/+ and E2f6-/- cells (Fig. 2E). The mutated reporter gene had equal activity in E2f6+/+ and E2f6-/- cells, demonstrating that the E2F site is required for repression by E2F6. "

"As observed for IRF-1 protein, the induction of IRF-1 mRNA expression was strongly suppressed by TGF-{beta}1. We next examined the expression of T-bet, because TGF-{beta}1 suppresses Th1 development largely through suppressing the expression of this Th1 transcription factor. T-bet mRNA expression was similar to that observed for IRF-1. That is, IFN-{gamma} strongly induced T-bet mRNA expression at 3 h, and this effect was completely suppressed by TGF-{beta}1 (Fig. 1B)."

"Of the 34 gene symbol probe sets, eight genes were identified where multiple probe sets for each gene reflected similar values (tmem2: transmembrane protein 2, thbs1: thrombospondin 1, slc7a6: solute carrier family 7, member 6, cyr61: cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61, vezatin: transmembrane protein vezatin, tuba3: tubulin, alpha 3, pro2730: hypothetical protein pro2730 and cdk6: cyclin-dependent kinase 6). For four genes (slc7a6, cyr61, tuba3 and pro2730), all the ascertained probe sets met the statistical criteria set earlier, whereas the other four genes had one or multiple probe sets meeting this criteria and additional probe sets with values not meeting this level of significance but showing expression changes in similar directions. We selected these eight transcripts to characterize further.  Real-time PCR analyses verified, in independent experiments, the increase of the selected eight transcripts in the heavy polyribosome fraction of miR-30a-3p {mirn30a} knocked down cells (Fig. 5).  "

"The epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) has been found to be over-expressed in several types of cancer cells and the regulation of its oncogenic potential has been widely studied. The paradigm for EGFR down-regulation involves the trafficking of activated receptor molecules from the plasma membrane, through clathrin-coated pits, and into the cell for lysosomal degradation. We have previously shown that oxidative stress generated by H{SUB2}O{SUB2} results in aberrant phosphorylation of the EGFR. This leads to the loss of c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination of the EGFR and, consequently, prevents its degradation. However, we have found that c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitination is required solely for degradation but not for internalization of the EGFR under oxidative stress. To further examine the fate of the EGFR under oxidative stress, we used confocal analysis to show that the receptor not only remains co-localized with caveolin-1 at the plasma membrane, but at longer time points, is also sorted to a perinuclear compartment via a clathrin-independent, caveolae-mediated pathway. Our findings indicate that although the EGFR associates with caveolin-1 constitutively, caveolin-1 is hyper-phosphorylated only under oxidative stress, which is essential in transporting the EGFR to a perinuclear location, where it is not degraded and remains active. Hence, oxidative stress may have a role in tumorigenesis by not only activating the EGFR, but also by promoting prolonged activation of the receptor both at the plasma membrane and within the cell."

"Table 4 Relative expression (RE) of 29 selected cellular genes in four study models by real-time RT-PCR - see comparisons below:  Model 2 (M2) values were normalized against the untreated control macrophages of model 1 (M1) at 24 h. Model 3 (M3) values were normalized against M1 at 72 h. Models 4 and 5 (M4 and M5) were normalized against M1 at 96 h.  M1@24, M1@72 and M1@96 denote control untreated macrophages whose RNAs were harvested and analyzed at 24, 72 and 96 h, respectively. M2@24 denotes LDL-treated macrophages with RNA analyzed at 24 h. M3@72 denotes macrophages infected with C. pneumoniae and RNA analyzed at 72 h. M4@96 denotes macrophages treated with LDL for 24 h, followed by C. pneumoniae infection for another 72 h before analyzing RNA at 96 h. M5@96 denotes macrophages infected with C. pneumoniae first for 72 h, followed by LDL treatment for another 24 h before analyzing RNA at 96 h. {for M4 and M5, results were combined and only the overlapping gene changes were modeled}  (from methods) The two-tailed t-test was then conducted to ascertain the statistical significance of the differences between the normalized relative expression values for each gene under the conditions stipulated for study models 2, 3, 4 and 5"

"Changes in gene expression after Oct4 {Pou5f1} or Nanog depletion {from full text results fig 6f}."
"Rcor2, Esrrb and Phc1 are examples of transcriptional regulators positively regulated by both Pou5f1 and Nanog factors (via RNAi). The Dkk1 gene, encoding for a Wnt antagonist, is negatively regulated by both Oct4 {Pou5f1} and Nanog (Fig. 6d). One interesting demonstration of Oct4-repressed genes is that of the trophectoderm marker genes Cdx2 and Cldn4: both were markedly upregulated upon Pou5f1 reduction"

"In contrast, the DNA binding activity of Smad3/4 was up-regulated by GSK-3{alpha} siRNA and appeared to be unaffected by GSK-3beta siRNA. Moreover, the activity of Smad3/4-responsive transcription was enhanced by GSK-3{alpha} siRNA and its dominant negative mutant but slightly reduced by GSK-3beta siRNA and its R96A mutant (Fig. 4B)."
"Moreover, protein-DNA array studies identified two novel GSK-3-regulated transcription factors, early growth response 1 and Smad3/4, which were oppositely affected by GSK-3alpha or GSK-3beta silencing or inhibition Binding activity of EGR-1-responsive element with EGR-1 was down-regulated by transfection with siRNA for GSK-3{alpha} but up-regulated by siRNA for GSK-3beta compared with the non-targeting siRNA control. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the transcriptional activity of EGR-1 was decreased by GSK-3{alpha} siRNA and its dominant negative mutant but increased by GSK-3beta siRNA and its dominant negative mutants (Fig. 4A)."

"Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, as well as its association with p85{alpha} and activation of IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, decreased after 15-30 min of insulin stimulation in PTP1B+/+ neonatal hepatocytes (Fig. 4, upper panel). In sharp contrast, the effect of insulin on IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in PTP1B-/- neonatal hepatocytes was prolonged; tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, IRS-1/p85{alpha} association, and IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity was sustained for 4 h in PTP1B-/- neonatal hepatocytes (Fig. 4, lower panel). Similar to findings for IRS-1, IRS-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, its binding to p85{alpha}, and activation of IRS-2-associated PI 3-kinase activity decreased between 15 and 60 min in insulin-stimulated PTP1B+/+ neonatal hepatocytes (Fig. 5, upper panel). However, insulin action was prolonged up to 4 h on this signaling pathway in PTP1B-/- neonatal hepatocytes (Fig. 5, lower panel). "

"{From full text}  For example, phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} by GCN2 (EIF2AK4) is enhanced by amino acid limitation, UV irradiation, and proteasome inhibition (13?16). Phosphorylation of eIF2{alpha} inhibits general protein synthesis by reducing the levels of eIF2-GTP that are required for binding of initiator tRNA to the translation apparatus. Concomitant with lowered protein synthesis, eIF2{alpha} phosphorylation leads to preferential translation of ATF4, a basic zipper (bZIP) transcription activator important for directing transcription of stress-related genes (17?20). Reduced protein synthesis conserves energy and provides the cell time for ATF4 and other stress-responsive transcription factors to reconfigure gene expression slated to alleviate damage elicited by the underlying stress. Other members of the eIF2 kinase family include PEK/Perk (EIF2AK3), whose activity is enhanced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (21, 22); HRI (EIF2AK1), which is regulated by heme deficiency and oxidative stress (23); and PKR (EIF2AK2), which functions in an antiviral pathway (24).{P@S52 is the common phosphorylation site between all 4 kinases and confirmed in Uniprot}"

"Overexpression of PrPC {PRNP} enhances tumor cell proliferation, cellular transformation, and tumorigenesis Our previous work has shown that PrPC could be detected in several human gastric cancer cell lines. Relatively lower PrPC expression was found in SGC7901 cells, but higher expression of PrPC was noted in AGS (12) . To show the differential effects of PrPC expression on cell proliferation, PRNP gene was stably transfected into human gastric cancer cell SGC7901 or was blocked by RNAi in AGS cells, respectively. After cell transfection and antibiotic selection for more than 2 mo, multiple drug-resistant clones were selected and the expression of PrPC in the cells was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 1 A).MTT assay, plate, and soft agar colony formation assays were done to examine the effect of PrPC on cell proliferation and cell transformation in vitro. Compared with empty vector-transfected cells and parental cells, PrPC-transfected cells showed significantly increased rate of cell proliferation as shown by MTT assay (Fig. 1B ). Anchorage-independent growth is one of the important characteristics of in vitro tumor growth; therefore, we examined whether up-regulation of PrPC expression could promote SGC7901 cell growth in soft agar and plate. As shown in Fig. 1C , PrPC transfection resulted in a marked accumulation of growth of SGC7901 in colony formation assay, with average increase rates of 65.1% and 58.6% in soft agar and plate assay, respectively. Down-regulation of PrPC by RNAi inhibited the colony formation both in soft agar and in plate.  To confirm this effect in vivo, we injected subcutaneously PrPC-expressing SGC7901 cells into the right back limb of nude mice. On day 25, the average tumor volume in SGC7901-PrPC group was 1.86 ± 0.29 cm3, compared with 0.84 ± 0.15 cm3 of the control group and 1.04 ± 0.21 cm3 of the vector group (Fig. 1D )."

"Caspase-8, an activator caspase that interacts with the death domain of the TNF receptor and CD95 (Fas) receptor, was activated in experimental emphysema caused by lung overexpression of either IFN-{gamma} (370) or IL-13 (196). "
"Chung (48, 49) summarized in detail the cytokines overexpressed in COPD (48, 49). IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-{alpha}, growth-related gene-{alpha} (Gro-{alpha})/keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC) (CXCL1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and IL-8 were increased in sputum, with further increases during exacerbations of COPD, and the bronchiolar epithelium overexpressed MCP-1, its receptor CCR2, MIP1{alpha}, and IL-8. MCP-1 and CCR2 were involved in the recruitment of macrophages and mast cells into the airway epithelium in COPD (62)."
"Heeschen et al. (111) involved nAChR {alpha}7-dependent (nAChR = CHRNA7) signaling in angiogenesis, based on testing the effects of the nAChR {alpha}7-antagonist {alpha}-bungarotoxin in endothelial cells (lung endothelial cells). {alpha}7-Mediated endothelial cell angiogenic networking depended partly on vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) and was completely reliant on signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), ERK, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), finally resulting in NF-{kappa}B activation."
"In support of activation of NF-kB in COPD, NF-{kappa}B was clearly responsible for enhancing the levels of IL-1 and TNF-{alpha}, via depletion of GSH and generation of ROS in the human macrophage-like cell line MonoMac6 stimulated by aqueous CSE (361)."
"Male Balb/c mice showed MUC5AC mRNA and protein expression, and goblet cell metaplasia after 8 days of intratracheal instillation of pancreatic elastase. These changes were mediated by elastase proteolytic activity and subsequent initiation of an inflammatory process documented by increases in Gro-{alpha}/KC and IL-5 (338). "
"Nicotine inhibited more efficiently than acetylcholine proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-{alpha} (TNF-{alpha}), interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 through a posttranslational mechanism in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (23, 342).Nicotine also inhibited the production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), monocyte inflammatory factor (MIP)-1{alpha} and MIP-1beta in these cells (309, 365). "
"Shapiro and colleagues (107) demonstrated that MMP-12-null mice are protected from the development of cigarette smoke-induced emphysema. Infiltrating macrophages in wild-type mice exposed to cigarette smoke might have been attracted by elastin fragments released by MMP-12, as MMP-12 knockout mice did not show evidence of increased alveolar macrophage accumulation due to chronic cigarettes smoke inhalation (124). When exposed to cigarette smoke for 2–3 days, MMP-12-null mice had an attenuated number of lung neutrophils and decreased expression of MIP-2, MIP-1{alpha}, and MMP-9 activity in BAL, suggesting that the MMP-9 response is dependent almost entirely on MMP-12 expression (180). "
"The mechanism of NF-{kappa}B activation due to cigarette smoke is controversial. CSE-induced IL-8 was mediated by IKK and NF-{kappa}B signaling in MonoMac6 cell (361). Cigarette smoke induced NF-{kappa}B DNA binding in the lung of mice in vivo (334), but the authors failed to observe phosphorylation and degradation of I{kappa}B. "
"nduction of IL-1beta caused by CSE was dependent on ERK1/2 and NF-{kappa}B in the human alveolar type II-like epithelial cell line A549 and HBEC. Surprisingly, phosphorylated I{kappa}B levels were decreased in a dose-dependent manner in spite of sustained activation of NF-{kappa}B (113)."

"{Modeled as TP63 and not taof because the 'dominant negative' TP63 lacking a transcriptional activation domain also activates the gene - SE}  We determined that the trans-activator (TA) isoforms of p63 activate MFGE8 transcription though a p53/p63 motif at -370, which was confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation experiment. Upon siRNA-mediated p63 silencing in a squamous cell carcinoma line, MFG-E8 production decreased to diminish Saos-2 cell adhesion. Interestingly, the DeltaN-p63 isoform lacking the TA domain enhanced the MFGE8-activating function of TA-p63"

"GILZ {Official Gene Symbol: Tsc22d3} has been proposed as a DEX-induced protein able to bind and inhibit p65NF-{kappa}B activity (Di Marco et al., 2007Go). We evaluated, by real-time PCR, the effect of DEX treatment in WT and PPAR-{alpha}KO cells on GILZ expression. Results in Fig. 6a indicate that DEX induced an increase of GILZ mRNA expression in WT but not in PPAR-{alpha}KO mice. Moreover, this difference was even enhanced in carrageenan-treated WT mice, thus indicating that PPAR-{alpha} contributes to DEX-induced GILZ expression."

"The two main CYP enzymes that are up-regulated by cigarette smoke are CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, which are regulated by ER{alpha} (18). Stimulation of estrogen receptor in the lungs increases protein expression of CYP1A1 by twofold (17). The increased CYP expression is also related to increased estradiol-? expression (19). CYPs are also involved in the bioactivation of 17?-estradiol, resulting in a positive feedback loop"

"Dual luciferase assay of PLC/PRF/5 cells transiently transfected with construct I-b1 mutated at the HNF1 site (construct I-b1[HNF1]mut; Figure 5) indicated that abrogation of the HNF1 element results in low promoter activity, with no response to the combination of UDCA and dexamethasone or to either of these compounds alone (Figure 11A). The fact that baseline transcriptional activity of construct I-b1[HNF1]mut was also markedly attenuated compared with that of the wild-type construct (4.5-fold; Figure 11A) suggested that an HNF1-bound transcription factor forms part of the baseline transcription machinery of AE2 {SLC4A2}alternate promoter in intact liver cells. ChIP assays against HNF1alpha in nuclear extracts from PLC/PRF/5 cells (with and without treatments) further supported such a view."

"Furthermore, inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK reduced ceramide-induced apoptosis, in part, via a mitochondrial pathway, as demonstrated by the 30% to 40% reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation (Figure 6D). "
"Our previous studies showed that etoposide may induce an apoptotic signaling pathway similar to that induced by ceramide.15,16 We thus determined the generation of ceramide in etoposide-treated Jurkat T cells. Results showed that etoposide induced ceramide generation within 1 hour (Figure 4A). Treatment with fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, and myriocin, an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase {SPTLC1, SPTLC2}, but not chlorpromazine and desprimine, inhibitors of acid sphingomyelinase, inhibited etoposide-induced cell apoptosis (Figure 4B), thus indicating a requirement for de novo ceramide generation. Furthermore, we demonstrated the increased expression of Txnip by etoposide (Figure 4C) "

"FIG. 24. Summary of the signaling pathways involved in the muscarinic regulation of pacemaker activity. In the SAN and AVN, ACh and Ado share the same pathways for signal transduction. ACh binds to the muscarinic M2 receptor, which is coupled to a \"direct\" G protein-dependent pathway activating Kir3.1/Kir3.4 (GIRK1/GIRK4) channel complexes. Beside this direct pathway, two other \"indirect\" channel regulation pathways lead to downregulation of intracellular cAMP. In the first cascade of events, the {alpha}Gi protein subunit inhibits AC activity, thereby reducing the synthesis of cAMP. Inhibition of AC synthesis is viewed as the predominant pathway by which ACh regulates the voltage dependence of f-channels (HCN). The second muscarinic pathway is initiated by the stimulation of the NOS activity and production of NO. NOS activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase (GC), which converts GTP in cGMP. Elevation of cGMP concentration stimulates PDE II-dependent hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby reducing PKA activity. This NOS-dependent pathway for regulation of PKA activity has been proposed to be the major pathway for the muscarinic regulation of ICa,L during pacemaking. In the figure, negative NOS-dependent regulation of Cav1.3-mediated ICa,L and Ist is suggested. It is not known if the SAN IKr can also be negatively regulated by the NOS-dependent pathway."

"In control animals, IL-1 was not detectable; however, its level was increased appreciably upon exposure to hypobaric hypoxia (Fig. 5a). A significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-{alpha}  levels also were noticed in the lungs of hypoxic rats. The fold increase in IL-6 and TNF-{alpha}  was 7 and 4.5 times, respectively, relative to control levels (Fig. 5b, c)."

"To determine if XIAP enhanced proinflammatory gene expression in vivo, we performed qRT-PCR analysis on splenic RNA from WT and XIAP knockout mice. RNA was isolated from splenocytes harvested from uninfected animals or animals infected with L. monocytogenes for 48 h (Figure 6) {to activate XIAP}.  The expression of il6 and ifng mRNAs were significantly enhanced in the presence of XIAP during infection."

". A major mechanism of cell necrosis is the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), which consists of multiple protein subunits, including adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). The threshold for mPTP opening is elevated by phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser9, which reduces activity of this kinase. {FROM FULL TEST: The mPTP is a non-selective large conductance channel in the mitochondrial inner membrane, which is physiologically closed. Opening of mPTPs is involved in cell death induced by a variety of causes (for example, ischemia/reperfusion, alcohol, endotoxin, anti-cancer agents), therefore 'opening' is modeled as tportof(mitochondrial permeability transition pore) and increased threshold for opening is modeled as decrease in tportof -SE}"

"GSK-3b activity restrains pro-apoptotic signaling from death receptors (ie, TNF-R1 {Official Gene Symbol: TNFRSF1A}, Fas, DR4 {Official Gene Symbol: TNFRSF10A}, DR5 {Official Gene Symbol: TNFRSF10B}).77?80 Inhibition of GSK-3b in the cells with activated death receptors enhanced activation of caspases-8 and -3, Bid cleavage and apoptosis, indicating that GSK-3b suppresses pro-apoptotic signals upstream of caspase activation.78?80 Thus, inactivation of GSK-3b under the condition of stimulation of death receptors promotes apoptosis."
"Second, our recent study suggests that binding of phospho-GSK-3b to ANT {Official Gene Symbol: Slc25a4} suppresses interaction of ANT with CypD {Official Gene Symbol: Ppid}, a trigger of mPTP opening.51 In isolated rat hearts, reperfusion after sustained ischemia induced translocation of cytosolic GSK-3b to the mitochondria, where it formed a complex with ANT and VDAC. Phosphorlylation of GSK-3b by ischemic preconditioning and erythropoietin (EPO) receptor activation was dependent on protein kinase C (PKC) and phosphatidiylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K), and phospho-GSK-3b was bound to ANT but not to VDAC at reperfusion (Figure 2A). {Phosphorylation of GSK3b is at what's described in the literature as Serine 9}"

"A striking feature of this element is its palindrome sequences and eight-base pair direct repeats. We have purified to near homogeneity a 66-68-kDa protein that binds to this region and have designated it alpha-PAL {Nrf1}. The alpha-PAL-binding site extends from -74 to -10. By methylation protection analysis and mobility shift assay, the alpha-PAL-binding site is shown to be two adjacent sites, one with high and one with lower affinity, which bind alpha-PAL in a noncooperative manner. When the high affinity binding site is cloned upstream of the adenovirus 2 core promoter, in vitro transcription is stimulated 2-3-fold. When linked to a CAT reporter gene, activity of the eIF-2 alpha {eif2s1} promoter shows an approximate 2-fold dependence on the alpha-PAL element {in a leukemia cell line}."
