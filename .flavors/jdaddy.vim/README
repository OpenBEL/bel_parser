Check out these *must have* mappings for working with JSON in Vim:

* `aj` provides a text object for the outermost JSON object, array, string, number, or keyword.
* `gqaj` "pretty prints" (wraps/indents/sorts keys/otherwise cleans up) the JSON construct under the cursor.
* `gwaj` takes the JSON object on the clipboard and extends it into the JSON object under the cursor.

There are also `ij` variants that target innermost rather than outermost JSON construct.
