dwm.vim adds tiled window management capabilities to Vim. 
It is highly inspired by dwm (Dynamic Window Manager) [http://dwm.suckless.org/] tiled layout management. 

Windows are always organised as follows: 

================= 
|              |       S1         | 
|              |========== 
|      M     |       S2         | 
|              |========== 
|              |       S3         | 
================= 

Use the following commands to create, close and browse windows: 

- CTRL-N Creates a new window and place it in the area [M] & stacks all previous windows in the [S] areas. 
- CTRL-C Close the current window if no unsaved changes 
- CTRL-J Jumps to next window (clockwise) 
- CTRL-K Jumps to previous window (anti-clockwise) 
- CTRL-H Focus the current window, that is, place it in the [M] area & stacks all other windows in the [S] areas 

There's only one tiled layout available right now, but the project is open for contribution:
